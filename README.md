# ðŸ§© Interactive Graph Editor
A Java-based interactive graph editor that allows users to create, visualize, edit, and save directed graphs with attributes â€” perfect for modeling a city's street network and computing shortest paths.

# âœ¨ Features
Graph Creation and Editing:

Add and remove vertices and edges interactively (mouse and keyboard controls).

Edit vertex and edge attributes (e.g., position, distance, street name).

Visualization:

Display the graph with customizable colors and styles.

Zoom in and out for easier navigation.

Shortest Path Calculation:

Compute shortest paths between nodes.

File Management:

Load and save graphs from files with structured descriptions.

Design Principles:

Built with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

UML-based design and analysis methodology.
